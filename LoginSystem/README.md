## Simple CLI login system
This is a very simple project that works like an authentication form. If the correct username and password is entered, it'll print "Correct credentials. Access granted" to simulate a login system in C++.

#### To be added or already added log:
- Passwords aren't compared using a plain text password, they are compared hashing the user input.
- User and password are in the same line and every new line is a new user.
- Administrator user can create and modify new users.
- Administrator can assign different permissions to different users.
- Users are loaded by a class.
- Implement diverse security measurements.
